My best friend, Anmol, is always there for me whenever I need assistance or encouragement. We shared experiences and made memories that I will cherish for the rest of my life. Anmol is the first person I think of in any urgent circumstance. When I am having difficulty, he always helps me by giving me the best ideas. The one person I can rely on completely for the rest of my life is my best friend, Anmol. We both help each other out whenever we can. We spend time almost everyday and find new exciting things to do together—be it trying new cuisines or reading new books.  </p>
